# Repository Intro

This is my repository for my learning journey. I just realize that writing is integral part of learning and growing. So, I will share my learning journey here. If this something that can help you, I'm happy.

As of now I will parallel update my 3 main content areas:
- ☕️ Java
- 💻 Spring Boot
- 🚀 AWS

Feel free to explore and join me on this exciting learning adventure! I believe in making tech learning fun and accessible for everyone.

Ok, enough talking. You can start explore.

Happy learning! ✨
Cheers,
Ardy
